# 🏁 SAE - Strategic AI Engineer

**SAE (Strategic AI Engineer)** is a project to optimize race strategy using AI.  
From pit decisions to setup tuning, weather adaptation, and driving assistance — SAE reduces the burden on drivers and engineers through intelligent support.

## 🎯 Purpose & Features

### 🧠 Real-Time Strategy AI
- Analyze vehicle and weather data to propose **optimal race strategies in real time**
- Automatically respond to special race conditions like safety cars (SC)

### 🛠 Auto Setup Suggestion
- Automatically propose **optimal car setups** using driver feedback and telemetry
- Analyze tire and suspension histograms to guide adjustments

### 🧑‍🏫 Driving Coaching
- Analyze telemetry and driving lines to **visualize ideal driving patterns**
- Use Fourier transforms and lap history comparison to **adapt driving to tire wear and fuel load**

### 🎮 Simulator Integration
- Initial development targets **Le Mans Ultimate (LMU)**
- Sim-like environments enable validation of strategy, driving, and setup AI modules

### 🔄 Strategy Simulation
- Predict and optimize **pit timing, weather response, fuel usage**, and more
- Leverages `.acp` (Abstract Compression Protocol) for scenario summarization and decision support

## 🌟 Vision

- Build an AI that acts as the driver's **"second race engineer"**
- Final goal: apply SAE to **real-world racing**
- Combine **raw on-track data** with AI to innovate speed, precision, and risk management
